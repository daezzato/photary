# How it's made:

Tech used: HTML (Embedded JavaScript), CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, Passport.js Mongoose, MongoDB

Photary is your own personal travel photo album. You have access to thousands of photos that showcase the beauty of every country around the world. You can create albums with your own titles, display all of your favorite photos, and leave notes of travel plans and ideas. In the Locations page, you can type in any country that you can think of and find inspiration to plan your future trips or moments of nostalgia that takes you on a trip down memory lane. 

The frontend of this application was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Embedded JavaScript was used to define HTML structures and pass data to render a fully functional site. The backend was made with Express.js and Node.js. MongoDB was used as the database system to store and manage the photo album data. Mongoose was also used to help bridge the communication gap between the Node.js application and the MongoDB database. Passport.js was used for the authentication process in which users would be able to create their own accounts. All of this was organized in a Model, View, Controller architecture.


# Lessons Learned:

This is my first ever project using all of these technologies combined. The amount of complexity involved showed me the inner workings of both the frontend and the backend. I learned how complicated and tedious styling can be with the amount of elements that need to be adjusted, along with finding the right colour combinations for a project of this size. My knowledge in JavaScript was significantly challenged as I had to learn how to build so many things ranging from servers, routers, and schemas to talk to the database using frameworks and libraries like Express and Mongoose. Embedded JavaScript really helped in rendering data dynamically due to its simple syntax. When I first learned about the Model, View, and Controller architecture, it seemed rather confusing at first. I wasn't grasping the concept as everything seemed so abstract. But after implementing it in this project, it definitely has helped me understand the importance of each aspect of this organizational structure.
